  ####How many of the steps you were able to complete by the end of the exam
  Four, but I couldnt get step 3 to work. Im submitting step 5, the readme late
  ####Which parts/concepts you found easy to implement, or felt you understood how to implement well
   Setting up the project was easy, adding the classes, views, layouts etc...
  ####Which parts/concepts you found hard to implement, or felt you did not completely understand how to implement well
Everything except the logic to get it work. I forgot simple things like committing my shared prefs or setting bundle arguments. I felt I was trying to rush through the test to get as much done as possible that I didnt go over my work and was only concerned with not having redlines
